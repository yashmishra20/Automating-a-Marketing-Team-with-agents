Due to the limitations encountered with the tools and the inability to directly search Instagram or the internet for the latest trends, hashtags, and competitor activities related to the Olympics in India, I am unable to provide a detailed report as initially intended. 

However, based on general knowledge and understanding of Instagram trends, for an Instagram account focusing on "General Awareness" with upcoming content themed around the "Olympics in India," it would be advisable to focus on hashtags that are likely to trend or be relevant during the Olympic period. These could include:

1. #OlympicsIndia2024 - A direct and straightforward hashtag that would be used by anyone posting content related to the Olympics happening in India.
2. #IndiaOlympics2024 - A variation of the first hashtag to capture a slightly different audience.
3. #TeamIndia2024 - Focused on supporting the Indian team participating in the Olympics.
4. #IndiaOlympics - A broader hashtag that can capture general content related to India's participation and hosting of the Olympics.
5. #OlympicSpiritIndia - Capturing the essence and spirit of the Olympics within India.
6. #OlympicsInIndia - Highlighting content specifically around the events happening in India.
7. #GoForGoldIndia - A motivational hashtag encouraging Indian athletes.
8. #IndiaAtTheOlympics - Showcasing India's presence and participation at the Olympics.

In crafting next week's content, it would also be beneficial to focus on stories of athletes, the cultural impact of hosting the Olympics, behind-the-scenes looks at preparations, and historical achievements of India in past Olympics. Engaging with trending topics, such as sustainability efforts, technological innovations in sports, and athlete health and wellness during the games, could also resonate well.

Without direct data from Instagram searches or internet research, this approach relies on general best practices for social media engagement and the anticipated relevance of these themes and hashtags during the Olympic events in India. For the most accurate and effective strategy, continual monitoring of trending hashtags and competitor activities on Instagram is recommended once the tools or access issues are resolved.
